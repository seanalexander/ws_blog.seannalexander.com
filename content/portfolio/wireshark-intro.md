[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is an open-source packet analysis suite. I use it for network troubleshooting, and debugging software that uses a network to communicate.

You can even use it to monitor traffic over a bluetooth interface, or USB.

I call it a suite for the sole reason that it comes with a bunch of utilities.
